# Unit 1: Print statements

print('hello world') # prints "hello world" onto the console/terminal

# Unit 2
    # 2.1 - Creating Variables

x = 5 # variable name, then = sign, then data/content you want the variable to store

print(x) # prints 5

# The data types in Python include: Integers/Whole Numbers, Floating-Point Numbers, Booleans, Strings

    # 2.2 - Reassigning a variable

x = 10

print(x) # prints 10 instead of 5

    # 2.3 & 2.7 - f strings

car = 'bmw'

print(f'I recently got a {car}') # prints "I recently got a bmw" onto the consoloe/terminal

    # 2.4 - String methods

name = 'John doe'

print(name.upper()) # prints "JOHN  DOE" onto the console/terminal. The .upper() turns all the letters in the string to uppercase letters

print(name.lower()) # prints "john doe" onto the console/terminal. The .lower() turns all the letters in the string to lowercase letters

print(name.title()) # prints "John Doe" onto the console/terminal. The .title() turns the first letter in every word to an uppercase letter

    # 2.5 - Printing quotation marks
 & 
print('Joe put "A" as his answer on the test') # prints 'Joe put "A" as his answer on the test' onto the console/terminal

    # 2.6 - Operations

# addition

print(10 + 2) # prints 12 onto the console/terminal

#subtraction

print(10 - 2) # prints 8 onto the console/terminal

#multiplication

print(10 * 2) # prints 20 onto the console/terminal

# division

print(10 / 2) # prints 5 onto the console/terminal

#modulus

print(10 / 3) # prints 1 onto the console/terminal

# finding the power of a number

print(10 ** 3) # prints 1000 onto the console/terminal
